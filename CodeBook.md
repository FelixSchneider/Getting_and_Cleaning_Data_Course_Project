# CodeBook
This codebook describes the data, the variables, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data. It is an update and modification of the file Â´features_info.txt` from the underlying base project.

## Description of the data and the variables
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (**`tBodyAcc-XYZ`** and **`tGravityAcc-XYZ`**) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (**`tBodyAccJerk-XYZ`** and **`tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ`**). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (**`tBodyAccMag`**, **`tGravityAccMag`**, **`tBodyAccJerkMag`**, **`tBodyGyroMag`**, **`tBodyGyroJerkMag`**). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing **`fBodyAcc-XYZ`**, **`fBodyAccJerk-XYZ`**, **`fBodyGyro-XYZ`**, **`fBodyAccJerkMag`**, **`fBodyGyroMag`**, **`fBodyGyroJerkMag`**. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each activity pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

## Complete list of variables
The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 
```
mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
```
They are indicated by the substrings `Mean` and `Std` as generated by the script `run_analysis.R`.

The resulting list of variables is as follows:
